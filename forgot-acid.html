    <h3>Have We Forgotten ACID? (DRAFT)</h3>
    <p>Ron Friedhaber, 2024</p>

    <p>
        Theres seems to be a slight rebirth of the Database industry, but one thing that's missing from many of the new
        databases, is
        ACID.
    </p>

    <p>
        Which is frankly perplexing, the whole point of a DBMS is proving atomicity, consistency, integrity, and
        durabillity gurrantees.
    </p>

    <p>Not all Application require such gurrantees, see Hacker News For Example, which <a
            href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5229522">(ran and probably still does)</a> on the POSIX File
        System.
